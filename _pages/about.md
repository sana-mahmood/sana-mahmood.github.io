I am a Computer Science PhD student at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Dr. Soudeh Ghorbani. My research focuses on improving the performance, scalability, and programmability of modern datacenter networks, particularly those used in AI and cloud infrastructures. My current work addresses emerging challenges in AI datacenters, including mitigating bandwidth inefficiencies in large-scale training workloads and ensuring scalable, high-throughput collective communication. I have also worked on enhancing RDMA flexibility to enable advanced performance-optimizing techniques such as adaptive load balancing and congestion mitigation, and on alleviating burstiness in datacenter traffic to improve stability and utilization. Broadly, my interests lie in building practical, architecture-aware network mechanisms that deliver efficiency and reliability at hyperscale.
